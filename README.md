# PrivateMultiplicativeWeights.jl

This package implements `MWEM`, a simple and practical algorithm for differentially private data release.

MIT Licensed. See `LICENSE.md`.

## Installation

Open a Julia prompt and call: 
```
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/mrtzh/PrivateMultiplicativeWeights.jl.git")
```

## Main Features

* Differentially private synthetic data preserving lower order marginals of an input data set
* Optimized in-memory implementation for small number of data attributes
* Scalable heuristic for large number of data attributes
* Easy-to-use interfaces for custom query sets and data representations

## Examples

### Histogram approximations

![Histogram approximation](https://github.com/mrtzh/PrivateMultiplicativeWeights.jl/blob/master/examples/histograms.png?raw=true)

Check out [`histograms.ipynb`](/examples/histograms.ipynb) for details on how to
use the algorithm to compute differentially private histogram approximations. 

### Marginal approximations

The package can also be used to create synthetic data that approximates the
lower order marginals of a data set with binary features.  For the sake of
illustration, we create a random data set with hidden correlations. Columns
correspond to data points.  

```
d, n = 20, 1000
data_matrix = rand(0:1, d ,n)
data_matrix[3, :] = data_matrix[1, :] .* data_matrix[2, :]
```

We can run MWEM to produce synthetic data accurate for 1st, 2nd, 3rd order marginals of the source data.
```
using PrivateMultiplicativeWeights
mw = mwem(Parities(d, 3), Tabular(data_matrix))
```
This will convert the data to its explicit histogram representation of size 2^d
and may not be useful when d is large. See section on factored histograms
for an alternative when the dimension d is large.

### Convert histograms to matrices

We can convert synthetic data in histogram representation to a tabular 
(matrix) representation.
```
table = Tabular(mw.synthetic, n)
```

### Compute error of approximation
Compute error achieved by MWEM:
```
maximum_error(mw), mean_squared_error(mw)
```
Note that these statistics are *not* differentially private.

## Parameters

Parameters can be set flexibly with the `MWParameters` constructor:
```
mw = mwem(Parities(d, 3),
          Tabular(data_matrix),
          MWParameters(epsilon=1.0,
                       iterations=10,
                       repetitions=10,
                       verbose=false,
                       noisy_init=false,
                       init_budget=0.05,
                       noisy_max_budget=0.5))
```
Available parameters:

| Name | Default | Description |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `epsilon` | `1.0` | Privacy parameter for the algorithm. MWEM is `epsilon`-differentially private. Each iteration of MWEM is `epsilon`/`iterations`-differentially private. Total privacy guarantees follow via composition theorems.|
| `iterations` | `10` | Number of iterations of MWEM. Each iteration corresponds to selecting one query via the exponential mechanism, evaluating the query on the data, and updating the internal state. |
| `repetitions`| `10` | Number of times MWEM cycles through previously measured queries per iteration. This has no additional privacy cost. |
| `noisy_init` | `false` | This requires part of the `epsilon` privacy cost.  When `noisy_init` is set to false, the initialization is uniform.  |
| `init_budget` | `=0.5` | In case the `noisy_init` flag is set to true, this flag decide what fraction of the `epsilon` privacy cost will be given for the noisy initialization. When `noisy_init` is set to false, all the budget will be used by the iterations. |
| `noisy_max_budget` | `0.05` | Decise what fraction from the `epsion` privacy badget of every iteration will go to the "noisy max" step. (the rest is for the Exponential Mechanism)  |
| `verbose` | `false` | print timing and error statistics per iteration (information is not differentially private)

The function `MWParameters` accepts any subset of parameters, e.g.,
`MWParameter(epsilon=0.5, iterations=5)`.

## Data representations

### Histogram representation

By default, MWEM works with the histogram representation of a data sets. This
means that the data is represented by a vector whose length is equal to the size
of domain. For example, data consisting of `d` binary attributes would be
converted to an array of length `2^d`. MWEM needs to store and array of this
length in main memory, which is often the computational bottleneck.

## Factored histograms

When the histogram representation is too large, try using factored histograms.
Factored histograms maintain a product distribution over clusters of attributes
of the data. Each component is represented using a single histogram. Components
are merged as it becomes necessary. This often allows to scale up MWEM by orders
of magnitude.  
```
d, n = 100, 1000
data_matrix = rand(0:1, d, n)
data_matrix[3, :] = data_matrix[1, :] .* data_matrix[2, :]
mw = mwem(FactorParities(d, 3), Tabular(data_matrix))
```

Also see `examples.jl`.

## Query representations

There are two ways to define custom query sets.

### Histogram queries

Histogram queries are linear functions in the histogram representation of the
data.  You can define custom query workloads by using
`HistogramQueries(query_matrix)` instead of `Parities(d, 3)`. Here `query
matrix` is an `N x k` matrix specifying the query set in its Histogram
representation, `N` is the histogram length and `k` is the `k` is the number of
queries.

### Custom query types

To build query sets with your own implicit representations, sub-type
`Query` and `Queries`. Implement the functions specified in `src/interface.jl`.

See `src/parities.jl` for an example.

### Available query sets

- **Parities**(d, k)

  Parities of `k` out of `d` attributes. This corresponds to approximating
  `k`-way marginals of the original data.

- **FactorParities**(d, k)

  Parities of `k` out of `d` attributes for factored histogram representation.

- **SeriesRangeQueries**(N)

  Range queries corresponding to all interval queries over a histogram of length `N`.
  
  - *SeriesRangeQueries**(Intervals)

  Range queries over histogram with length N, corresponding to intervals = {Interval1, Interval2, ...}
  where Interval = (i, j) so that 1 <= i <= j <= N.
